# myblog

## GitHub Repository URL
[\[GitHub repository URL\]](https://github.com/utsabg/blog/tree/feature/auth-admin-panel)

## Project Approach 
This project is a basic CRUD application for managing blog posts using Laravel 11 Along With 3 roles of user Viewer , Editor and Admin. This application allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. 
The development process is according to the provided guidelines, ensuring a structured and functional application.
I have referenced the Lecture material at mylearn and laravel documentation at https://laravel.com/docs/11.x and bootstrap 5 snippets at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/ 

### Setup and Initialization of Project
First i achieved the following requirement for development environment. My setup steps included the following

- Installed and set up Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Node.js, Git, Composer, mySql for this , and Laragon (Windows) for development.
- Created a new GitHub repository branch of the existing Laravel project .

#### This project can be downloaded and runed by the following steps:
- Step 1: download the Laravel project (Blog) feature branch
- Step 2: Install Composer Dependencies.
- Step 3: Set Up the Environment and env file with blog as dbname.
- Step 4: migrate db and seed faker data into the database
- Step 6: Serve the Laravel Project.

### My development approach
Pushed the initial setup generated by laravel by default and npm to the GitHub repository.
I removed the unnessary views and routes. 
Added Middleware for authentication 
Implemented User CRUD 
I created the Post model and User model and created a migration for user tables and seeders.
Then i defined the simple and short schema for the tables in the migration file and ran the migration.
seeders and migrations can be run by using following commands 
php artisan migrate:fresh
php artisan db:seed [ this will create editors with posts to show by default ]
php artisan db:seed --class=UserSeeder [this will create 3 default viewer editor and admin @example.com with default password "password"]
Following lecture established all db connections using mongodb maintained post controller and user controller.
I also Created the master layout for admin dashboard using given bootstrap template following the lecture, 
Created required views and tested if other user can access or not wy establishing conditions based on role. 

Perodically pushed to git for version control.

### Challenges Faced
Mongo Db connection -  I faced issues with database connection as it had few issues later refreshed the code and started fresh to resolve it. Another issue i faced was using default authentication for some reasun it was not connecting well with database when wrong input was used to login later fixed it implementing my own validation rather than default which took me extra time beyond deadline.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
